Traditionally worked in natural materials like stone, clay, and metal, sculpture encompasses both free-standing works “in-the-round” and reliefs, often serving as architectural elements. Sharing the viewer’s space more literally than any other medium, sculpture has given rise to some of the most iconic works in art history, including the classical Greek _Venus de Milo_ (c. 130-100 B.C.), [Michelangelo](/artist/michelangelo-buonarroti)’s [High Renaissance](/gene/high-renaissance) _David_ (1504), Rodin’s _The Thinker_ (1902), and [Constantin Brancusi](/artist/constantin-brancusi)’s [_The Kiss_](/artwork/constantin-brancusi-the-kiss-le-baiser) (1908).

    "description": "The Gutai Group was one of the most important artist collectives in postwar Japan. Founded by Yoshihara Jirō in 1954 near Osaka, its name translates as “concrete,” a reflection of the artists’ desire to push beyond the abstract painting of the day with experiments in pure materiality. Using everything from mud and Elmer’s glue to plastic tubing and sound art, these artists strove to create new, vital experiences that blurred the boundaries between art and life. Early experiments, such as [Kazuo Shiraga](/artist/kazuo-shiraga)’s calligraphic paintings made by smearing paint around on a canvas, evoking the gestural abstraction of [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock) or [Art Informel](/gene/art-informel), were soon followed by an emphasis on performances, immersive installations, and video. For a nation recently defeated in World War II and emerging from the shadow of totalitarianism, Gutai’s call for vitality, play, and new artistic frontiers served as a jolt to a culture of consensus. The group actively promoted itself abroad through the distribution of mail art and a well-circulated journal, and in 1958 prominent New York dealer Martha Jackson staged an exhibition of their work. Gutai’s focus on performance and materiality has often been cited as a precursor to [Arte Povera](/gene/arte-povera) and [performance art](/gene/performance-art) of the 1960s.",

In the collage, a printed oilcloth simulated chair caning and a piece of rope functioned as both a frame and the border of a café table. Collage was an assault on painting and its proposal of imaginary space as well as the proper materials of art. For example, [Kurt Schwitters](/artist/kurt-schwitters)' collages and assemblages brought the detritus of street life and modern life's [printed ephemera](/gene/printed-matter)—ticket stubs, newspapers, postage stamps—into the realm of high art. The development of collage in art ran parallel to experiments in poetry and literature in the early 20th century, where aesthetic principles of fragmentation, reassembly, and multiple meanings reflected the rapid societal and technological changes ushered in by modernism and urbanization.",

The bold mark of a woodcut and the (often apparent) wood grain impression contrasts the more fluid mark of the linocut. During the 15th century, German artist [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) mastered the technique of carving into wood, finessing the vigorous woodcut mark into articulated fine lines; centuries later, [Expressionists](/gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism) like [Ernst Ludwig Kirchner](/artist/ernst-ludwig-kirchner) and [Emil Nolde](/artist/emil-nolde) would revive the German woodcut tradition, exploring the medium’s graphic potential with more aggressive marks and flat planes of color.

Japanese objects were especially fashionable in Paris and London, and the term Japonisme was coined in 1872 by Parisian critic Phillippe Burty, whose vast collection of Japanese artworks drew the attention of [Edgar Degas](/artist/edgar-degas) and numerous Impressionists. Japanese aesthetics, as exemplified by _Ukiyo-e_ (\"Pictures of the Floating World\"), inspired asymmetric compositions, flattened modeling, calligraphic brushstrokes, pure bright colors, and the representation of transient, everyday scenes.

In the 20th century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, the term has become more generally associated with mass commodities or cheap entertainment, considered decorative or evocative of lowbrow taste. Kitsch suffered its most serious intellectual blow in art circles when Clement Greenberg railed against it in a famous 1939 essay, in which he claimed it anathema to progressive, avant-garde art since it pandered to the masses. The rise of consumerism in the United States and Europe in the 1950s and '60s generated an artistic interest in popular culture, however, often with an eye towards dismantling the divide between ostensibly “fine art” and mass appeal; nowhere was this more notable than with the rise of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) in the United States. Today, the idea that something can be “so bad it’s good” is so common that the term “kitsch” no longer retains the negative associations it once did, and artists today often create works that embrace bad taste and question the high- and lowbrow division in art. Importantly, while kitsch is generally associated with European or American culture, it has parallels throughout the world. For example, the concept of kawaii—or cuteness—in Japanese culture is a quality opposed to the aesthetic ideal of refinement and plays a prominent role in popular culture and entertainment.",

On a more intimate scale, the pietà (Mary mourning of the body of Christ) became a commonly painted and sculpted subject beginning in the 13th century in Northern Europe; it soon spread to the south, and continued to appear regularly into the 17th century. The vanitas image, a reflection on the transitory nature of human existence that includes memento mori like skulls or hourglasses, was popularized in 17th-century Netherlands. From the 18th to the 19th centuries, French painting saw a shift from the admiring scenes of mortal struggle by [Romantics](/gene/romanticism) to sedate scenes by Realists, such as Gustave Courbet’s [_Burial at Ornans_](/artwork/gustave-courbet-the-burial-at-ornans).

Depictions continued in [Roman art](/gene/roman-art), where the putto (male infant) depicted with grape vines was a common motif.

After the First World War, the utopian and spiritual elements of this tendency gave way to the more political ideas of groups like the Dresden Secession and the Novembergruppe, many of whose members later became associated with [Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)](/gene/neue-sachlichkeit). Expressionism was a lightning-rod issue for Communists and National Socialists alike, for whom it often became a stand-in for Modern art at large.

Announcing their aspirations in the form of a manifesto—the “Manifesto Blanco,” or white manifesto—the students, under Fontana’s direction, called for new art forms that embraced the latest scientific concepts derived from modern physics. Taking inspiration from the [Futurists](/gene/futurism)’ fascination with technology, they advocated for abandoning painting in order to develop an art suitable for the mechanical age, one “based on the unity of space and time.” In Fontana’s infamous “Concetto spaziale” series, the canvases’ stigmata-like lacerations represent the artist’s attempt to articulate Spatialist concepts by transforming a two-dimensional canvas into a three-dimensional space.",

    "description": "A shortening of the phrase \"landscape art,” used interchangeably with Earthworks to refer to pieces made of materials derived from the earth or situated on or within a landscape. Such works are usually site specific—created for and utilizing aspects or characteristics of a particular location. Both American and European artists began to use dirt, rocks, and sand as media and subject matter in the late 1960s, experimenting with diverse approaches. In 1967 the English artist [Richard Long](/artist/richard-long) walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph _A Line Made by Walking_. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson)’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, _Spiral Jetty_, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore. Some of these works address ecological issues like those concerning activists in the 1960s. Alan Sonfist’s _Time Landscape_, for instance, which he proposed in 1965 and implemented in 1978, re-creates the original landscape on a small plot in Manhattan, calling attention to what is lost through urbanization and development.",

Recent scholarship on Minimalism, however, has argued for its embeddedness in the politics of its day: the use of industrial materials, such as steel and Plexiglas, spoke to American military-industrial prowess, while repeated modular elements conjured a consumer society of replication.

It also has a long history in East Asian ink-and-wash painting.

Some are highly polished while others evidence a rough construction, as in the terracotta models used by the eighteenth-century French sculptor [Antonio Canova](/artist/antonio-canova) in preparing for his larger marble works. Modern artists including [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) challenged the provisional status of the maquette by executing finished works in a rough maquette-like technique—for example, in _Cirque Calder_ (1926–31), [Alexander Calder](/artist/alexander-calder) performed a cast of wire-sculpted characters and miniature circus props.",

The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed.

Walter Benjamin wrote of photographs, \"from a negative… one can make any number of prints; to ask for the 'authentic' print makes no sense.\" Such a blurring of the boundary between \"original\" and \"copy\" through repetition paved the way for the factory-like appropriation and creation of images from mass media found in the [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) of Andy Warhol, who in addition to silkscreening images of Campbell's soup cans over and over again was said to have eaten the brand of soup for lunch every day for twenty years.

With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences.

For example, [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti)'s architectural designs made explicit reference to musical harmony and employed ratios that he thought would produce consonances.

The early 16th century saw a new focus on portraits of soldiers, with German artists favoring a more closely observed and realistic style than their Italian counterparts. The 17th century saw the rise of war paintings lacking a hero, as well as the advent of some of the first seemingly antiwar works, such as [Jacques Callot](/artist/jacques-callot)'s _Misères de la Guerre_ (1633).

Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted. Many variations in the photographic portrait resulted as did the exploration of how abstract painting might still make a portrait.

As such, they have long appeared alongside images in artworks, and in some cases, are the artwork's essential characteristic. Ancient artifacts such as the [Rosetta Stone](/artwork/the-rosetta-stone-1) and the Code of Hammurabi demonstrate the long-standing role of texts in commanding political and moral authority, a tradition that continued, for instance, with the use of inscriptions on Roman monuments. In many cases, texts take on striking visual characteristics of their own: Egyptian hieroglyphics consisted of small, figurative symbols, elaborate Arabic scripts served as essential decorative elements in religious spaces where figurative representation was banned, and Medieval manuscripts often included exquisitely detailed lettering. Much more recently, text has played a central role in modern and contemporary movements: [Georges Braque](/artist/georges-braque)'s Cubist paintings featured words tucked between lines of fractured geometry, while [Roy Lichtenstein](/artist/roy-lichtenstein)'s cartoonish [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) paintings often contained quote bubbles. Conceptual art up to the present has made heavy use of texts, as seen in [Joseph Kosuth](/artist/joseph-kosuth)'s dictionary definitions, [Jenny Holzer](/artist/jenny-holzer)'s \"truisms\", and [Lawrence Weiner](/artist/lawrence-weiner)'s wall pieces.",

Originally referring to a specific process of using heat to fuse beeswax with pigment and resin, encaustic has become a more general term for the use of wax and painting in tandem. Because of its durability, encaustic was most likely first used by the Greeks in order to waterproof and decorate ships, but eventually found its way into more traditional forms of art. After the fall of the Byzantine empire, where the medium appears in many religious icons, encaustic largely disappeared until the 18th century when it was used by artists trying to imitate Greek and Roman Art. In the 20th century, encaustic is most often associated with the work of [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns), who used it in his Flag paintings, the first of which was displayed in 1955. Because of its versatility, other artists, such as [Martin Kline](/artist/martin-kline), [Brice Marden](/artist/brice-marden), and [Lynda Benglis](/artist/lynda-benglis), continued to work with encaustic throughout the 20th century and into the present day.",

With the rise of abstract art in the 20th century, realist painting ceased to be the dominant mode of art-making, being viewed as less progressive, or even retrograde.

For example, Canadian contemporary artist [Marcel Dzama](https://www.artsy.net/artist/marcel-dzama) produces set designs for art film and ballet that transplant the viewer into a dark and fantastical universe; and [Kim Keever](https://www.artsy.net/artist/kim-keever) takes swirling photographs that capture the element of chance.

    "description": "A term coined by Dutch artist and architect [Theo van Doesburg](/artist/theo-van-doesburg) in 1930 to describe abstract art based on mathematic or scientific principles, the visual expression of which was an emphasis on planes and color. Concrete Art has since been associated with other schools of abstraction that spurned expression or gesture, such as the [Bauhaus](/gene/bauhaus) and [Constructivism](/gene/constructivism). Later to be called \"cold abstraction,\" this style was often criticized for its transcendental bent and failure to confront the world. [Lucio Fontana](/artist/lucio-fontana), for example, though associated briefly with the Italian Movimento Arte Concreta (M.A.C.), ultimately found his practice to be at odds with the \"sterile and empty\" formalism of this tendency. A central concept in much of Concrete Art was the idea of “real space,” which was further explored in its Latin American iterations like Arte Concreto-Invención, Arte Madí and the Grupo Neoconcreto. After flourishing for some 20 years, by the 1950s the cerebral concerns of this art—its exploration of pure form and universal principles—were being eclipsed by the more expressive gestural abstraction coming out of the [New York School](/gene/new-york-school) and the [School of Paris](/gene/post-world-war-ii-school-of-paris).",

Variations on this practice have existed around the world, with early instances including ancient Egyptian papyrus painting, ancient Chinese silk painting, and medieval manuscripts. Greater standardization in watercolor production was furthered by the wide distribution of a list of usable pigments in 17th-century England and the invention of portable watercolor boxes in the early 18th century. Old Masters like [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) and [Sir Anthony Van Dyck](/artist/sir-anthony-van-dyck) used the medium primarily for landscapes, though often as a delicate accent in ink and chalk drawings. Watercolor gained its strongest standing in the United Kingdom, with watercolorists gaining admission to the Royal Academy by the end of the 18th century and [J. M. W.

The Swiss artist Max Bill, a major exponent of Concrete Art, had significant exhibitions in São Paulo, Brazil in the early 1950s, inspiring a younger generation of artists there. In 1959, the _Neo-Concrete Manifesto_ was written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro—including [Lygia Clark](/artist/lygia-clark), [Hélio Oiticica](/artist/helio-oiticica), and Lygia Pape—who shared a similar interest in abstract forms and the use of color but wanted to insert poetic, and sometimes political, meaning and a greater sense of freedom and flexibility into their work. The merging of art and life was crucial: painting was to be removed from its frame, sculpture taken down from its pedestal, and the work constantly subject to re-invention by its viewers. This led to developments in participatory and immersive art, as exemplified by Oiticica's penetrable environments and wearable sculptures or Pape's envisioning of a world without words in _Book of Creation_. The critic Ronaldo Brito called Neo-Concrete Art a \"rupture\" in Brazilian art history, one that would inspire later generations of artists in Brazil, including those practicing under the repressive military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985.",

    "description": "Islamic Art generally refers to work made beginning in the 7th century, a period when the Islamic faith was first developing under the prophet Muhammad, in regions in which Islam was the dominant religion. While Islam shares the prophetic tradition of Judaism and Christianity, the monotheistic religion has its own tenets and rituals, such as the belief in Allah as the one god and Muhammad as his prophet, daily prayer, charity, fasting during Ramadan, and, if possible, a pilgrimage to Mecca. However, Islamic art is difficult to define: not all Islamic art is religious, and not all artists who created it were Muslim. Islamic art includes [architecture](/gene/architecture-1), [calligraphy](/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy), decorative arts ([carpets](/artwork/turkey-ottoman-prayer-rug), ceramics, and metalware, among other examples), and [painting](/gene/painting) and stems from territories as diverse as the Arab world: Iranian lands, Turkey, India, China, and Spain. Early instances of Islamic art combined elements from existing traditions within [Greco-Roman](/gene/greek-and-roman-art-and-architecture), [Byzantine](/gene/byzantine-art), and Sasanian art, as exemplified by [The Dome of the Rock](/artwork/the-dome-of-the-rock-interior-view) in Jerusalem. Over time, Islamic art developed a unique artistic language whose hallmarks included all-over decoration and the use of vegetal and geometric patterns, such as the [Arabesque](/gene/arabesque-slash-scroll), among other forms. As writing is highly valued in Islam, calligraphy is ubiquitous, serving as decoration for objects and buildings. Additionally, while figuration is found in secular examples of Islamic Art, it is absent from religious works, in which the depiction of the human form is considered idolatry. While maintaining common elements, Islamic art across the globe is highly diverse, linking the [Alhambra Palace](/artwork/granada-spain-alhambra) in Granada, Spain, to the [Taj Mahal](/artwork/agra-india-mughal-period-taj-mahal) in India.",

With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction.",

As an architectural philosophy, Brutalism was often associated with utopian socialist ideology. Completed in 1952, Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse—a public housing complex in Marseille that was built under the premise that each resident should have the same amount of space and equal access to sunlight—is often cited as the initial inspiration for the Brutalist style. Criticism of the style centers around its cold appearance.

    "description": "The concept of the afterlife—a realm after death in which the deceased retain some form of existence—is central to the philosophy and religion of many pre-modern cultures and finds explicit manifestation in the artwork of such cultures. In ancient Greek and Roman funerary tombstones, the deceased are depicted in the company of living family members, a convention often interpreted to represent the continuing connection between the living and the dead and the possibility of reunion in the afterlife. In contemporary art, [Damien Hirst](/artist/damien-hirst)’s _Monument to the Living and the Dead and I Am Become Death, Shatterer of Worlds_ explore the fluid boundaries of existence between life and death. Rather than providing concrete depictions of the afterlife, Hirst’s works imply that mankind experiences a continually present living death.",

Indeed, the forward-looking Venetian school was also responsible for the shift toward the now-dominant use of oil paint on canvas and wood panel as opposed to fresco wall painting, perhaps owing to the overwhelming humidity near the sea. The school's influence proved great stylistically, too: its pleasure-seeking, even poetic sensibility, which stood in contrast to the cool, studied quality of Italian [Mannerism](/gene/mannerism) paved the way for the melodramatic vividness of 17th century [Baroque](/gene/baroque).",

Developments in lighting saw rapid changes during the Industrial Revolution. Gas street lamps arrived in London in 1815; the electric arc lamp, made from two carbon electrodes, was developed in the early 19th century and first used at the Paris Opéra in 1844; and the Englishman Joseph Swan and American Thomas Edison developed the first incandescent electric lamps in 1878 and 1879, hugely increasing access to electrical lighting. Iconic lamp designs, such as those by [Tiffany Studios](/artist/tiffany-studios) and [Isamu Noguchi](/artist/isamu-noguchi), have become iconic, historical works.

    "description": "Artworks that depict Greek and Roman mythology. Greek mythology, concerned largely with the lives of gods and heroic humans, has origins in oral tradition but was recorded by poets such as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Roman mythology, which borrowed heavily from Greek predecessors, often dealt with myths of origin, social institutions, and human destiny; key poets included Virgil and Ovid and central stories include those of the She-Wolf of the Capitoline and the Rape of the Sabine Women. Mythological narratives were represented widely in Greek and Roman art, particularly in pottery, sculpture, and mosaics. The allegorical power of the widely known stories remained long after the decline of associated pagan religions, and overlaps between pagan and Christian imagery are visible in the tombs of the earliest Christians. While classical imagery was largely dormant in the Medieval period, it returned in full force in iconic Renaissance paintings and sculptures by the likes of [Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli), [Titian](/artist/tiziano-vecellio-called-titian), and [Raphael](/artist/raphael-raffaello-sanzio-da-urbino) in Italy and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) in Germany, all of whom sought to reconcile Christian piety with Classical thought. Subsequent painters who dealt regularly with classical themes included [Peter Paul Rubens](/artist/peter-paul-rubens) and [Nicolas Poussin](/artist/nicolas-poussin), and in 17th- and 18th-century academic painting, the use of classical stories was an esteemed technique. In the last two centuries, artists have treated classical myths with a great deal of flexibility, examples including [Gustave Moreau](/artist/gustave-moreau)'s Symbolist depictions, [Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)'s works concerning the Spanish Civil War, and [Romare Bearden](/artist/romare-bearden)'s retelling of classical stories with black subjects.",

The prophet Muhummad's revelations, which were recorded as the contents of the Qu'ran, occurred in the early part of the 7th century. During the spread of Islam in subsequent centuries, a legible script printed on parchment was essential for transporting and sharing the Qu'ran. In the 9th century, paper became the preferred medium, which led to the development of a more fluid, cursive script in place of the more angular style of the past; paper permitted not only the spread of religious texts, but also the publishing of large numbers of secular books. Farsi calligraphy reached its height around 1400 AD and was regularly used for poetry. While Arabic continued to be the language of sacred texts, Farsi was considered the language of highest literary merit, even as far away as the Ottoman and Mughal empires (present-day Turkey and India, respectively). Images of God were forbidden by the Qu'ran, and figurative art was often suspected of idolatry, so calligraphy is amongst the highest art forms in the Muslim world. Contemporary uses of calligraphy can be found in [Ghada Amer](/artist/ghada-amer)'s sculptures, [Shirin Neshat](/artist/shirin-neshat-2)'s photography, and [Shahzia Sikhander](/artist/shahzia-sikander)'s drawings and paintings.",

Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings.

With changing tastes and attitudes in Europe, commercial tapestry production substantially decreased in the 19th century. Interest in tapestry was renewed in the late 19th century by the [Arts and Crafts movement](/gene/arts-and-crafts-movement) in England and the Wiener Werkstätte in Germany, which advocated preindustrial craftsmanship. In the 20th century, artist [Anni Albers](/artist/anni-albers) was a proponent of tapestry weaving at the [Bauhaus](/gene/bauhaus) and at [Black Mountain College](/gene/black-mountain-college), while present-day artists such as [Sheila Hicks](/artist/sheila-hicks) continue in this tradition.

    "description": "Most likely derived from the decoration of metal armor in Northern Europe during the 15th century, etching and engraving are the two major intaglio printmaking techniques. Though they produce visually similar results, etching involves incising a wax-coated metal plate with a sharp tool and placing the plate into an acid bath. The acid corrodes the exposed lines, leaving the waxy ground unaffected; the plate is then inked and printed, forcing the paper into the incised lines. Considered one of the great masters of the technique, [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) harnessed the medium’s similarity to drawing with a pencil or pen. Engraving, the oldest intaglio technique and the most common method seen in Old Master prints, involves directly incising a metal matrix and then printing. Engraving arguably reached its pinnacle with [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer), who mastered the technique's precise and tapered lines to achieve great tonality as seen in [this print](artwork/albrecht-durer-st-anthony).",

As cultural traditions changed rapidly in the late 19th century, artist Ravi Varma pioneered the use of color lithography to mass-produce his Western-influenced paintings of Hindu deities, subjects that contemporary Indian painter [Manjit Bawa](/artist/manjit-bawa) also later depicted, referring to them as “icons of my country.”",

A history painting was generally understood to depict an important event or action involving several people. These events could be historical, religious, mythical, or the stuff of fable. History painting was long considered to be the highest (and most challenging) genre of painting, due to its connection to powerful subject matter and its ability to educate the public in lofty themes and virtues. Before the 19th century, history painting was subject to certain requirements—as elucidated by [Joshua Reynolds](/artist/sir-joshua-reynolds), among others.

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography. The invention of digital photography and advances in printing technologies have further expanded its scope—from digital manipulation to the monumental printing techniques often associated with the [Dusseldorf School of Photography](/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography)—and contemporary artists continue to explore new paths for color photography, such as through the use of [photograms](/gene/photogram), diaristic works, or even approaching the photographic print as a sculptural material.",

In the 1st century CE a new type of architecture took advantage of refinements in the use of the material, as in [the Pantheon](/artwork/apollodorus-of-damascus-the-pantheon) in Rome, constructed of a large dome atop a massive concrete cylinder. Strong, cheaper than traditional stone, and easily transportable, concrete is made by combining water with an aggregate (such as small pieces of stones or brick) and a binder (such as lime or cement) and then allowing the malleable mass to harden; it is often reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to increase its tensile strength. Underutilized for centuries after the classical period, it became a mainstay of modern architecture and infrastructure. It has been used to construct both masterpieces of aesthetic innovation, such as Le Corbusier’s [_Notre Dame du Haut_](/artwork/le-corbusier-chapelle-de-notre-dame-du-haut-ronchamp-france), and the massive housing blocks and anonymous, utilitarian structures that fueled 20th-century urbanization.

In a series of sober portraits from the 1920s, German photographer [August Sander](/artist/august-sander) systematically documented his countrymen; the uniform staging and composition of these works accentuated social and professional markings, turning his subjects into social types. This series revealed a tension between a photograph’s ability to reveal something of a sitter’s individuality and inner life, and its exact representation of outward appearance. In recent practice, many photographers have also tried to present their subjects as they really are, flaws and all, while allowing for moments of candidness and vulnerability. Less austere (and more deliberate) than a mug shot, these works often bring facial features into high relief, allowing expressiveness to recede and making the sitter seem somehow up-close and removed at the same time.

    "description": "A term used to describe a tendency in architecture that began in the 1980s and rejected the basic premises of modern architecture. Architects who worked in this tradition spurned functionalist, anonymous aesthetics, instead focusing on complex geometries and surface treatments. Inspired in part by the theories of semiotic analysis known as “deconstruction” developed by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, they dissected standard modernist forms (such as the cube and right angles), often creating spaces with a preponderance of angles (regarding the angularity of her designs, [Zaha Hadid](/artist/zaha-hadid) has commented, “There are 360 degrees, so why stick to one?”). Deconstructivism is most closely associated with the architects Peter Eisenman, [Frank Gehry](/artist/frank-gehry), Hadid, Coop Himelblau, [Rem Koolhaas](/artist/rem-koolhaas), Daniel Liebeskind, and Bernard Tschumi, largely due to the Museum of Modern Art’s 1988 exhibition “Deconstructivist Architecture,” which first brought them together. Most of these architects, however, reject this association because it implies a homogenous style or set of concerns. While there is disagreement as to the nature of deconstructivism, the architect Philip Johnson (co-curater of the MoMA exhibition) has summarized it by saying, “It is the ability to disturb our thinking about form that makes these projects deconstructive.”",

Whistler titled his paintings as _Harmonies_ and _Symphonies_, using the language of music to deemphasize the importance of the specific subjects depicted and instead focus on the image’s holistic mood, color, surface and composition. [Japonisme](/gene/japonisme)—the late 19th century European craze for Japanese art and aesthetics—was a major influence not only on Whistler’s paintings, but also in the decorative arts.

Other CAM processes include subtractive techniques, in which material is removed from a large starting block (usually of wood or metal) until the digitally designed form is achieved. The two most common types of this technique are CNC routing and milling. Both use a movable rotating cutter guided by digital instructions that cut into and carve a starting block of material.

    "description": "Invented in 1949 by paint salesman Ed Seymour to apply aluminum coating to radiators, spray paint is paint that sprays onto any surface (walls, wood, metal, glass, plastic, or canvas) from an aerosol can. By 1979, an entire spray-paint industry had developed, with over 270 million cans being sold annually in the United States. This rise coincided with the prominence of graffiti art in the 1970s, a form centered in New York City. Spray paint was portable, affordable, and easy to use, making it the medium of choice for the illegal activity. Some early practitioners of graffiti art included Lady Pink, CRASH, Lee Quinones, and Fab 5 Freddy. In the 1990s and 2000s, contemporary graffiti artists such as [Shepard Fairey](https://www.artsy.net/artist/shepard-fairey) and [Banksy](https://www.artsy.net/artist/banksy) built on these earlier artists’ work. Galleries began showing graffiti paintings in the 1980s, and since then spray paint has been increasingly used by non-graffiti artists, including Peter Peri, Blue and Joy, Rita Ackermann, and Jaybo Monk, often in combination with other materials and techniques. Spray paint has a noticeable aesthetic, void of brushstrokes, and many application techniques, including burns, fades, and flares. Depending on the amount of pressure painters apply to the nozzle and the time they spend in a particular spot, spray-paint lines can be thin, thick, layered, splattered, and/or dripped. The graffiti artist KATSU [has recently advanced](https://www.artsy.net/article/editorial-the-spray-paint-armed-drones-of-graffiti-artist) spray-painting techniques using new technology by spraying paint from drones.",

In this period, artistic patronage shifted increasingly towards the capitalist bourgeoisie and national academies, with a rising profile for art dealers and critics. The hub of Western artistic activity was Paris, and the French Academy and Salon represented the establishment, favoring [Neoclassicism](/gene/neoclassicism) at the beginning of the century and later [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism).

    "description": "The 17th century was marked by increasingly robust global networks of trade, which brought a great deal of exchange of artistic objects and the global spread of styles. This was facilitated by British and Dutch trading companies in South Asia, the trade routes of the Ottoman Empire, and the Spanish administration of South America, amongst many other channels. China, Japan and Korea each experienced dramatic economic expansion and artistic flourishing, but while Chinese goods travelled widely through the global market, Japan maintained a closed economy. The great variety of artistic production in Europe in the 17th century is often loosely grouped under the term “[Baroque](/gene/baroque)”, which in general terms is characterized by a heightened sense of movement and lighting in compositions. In painting, these elements were perhaps first mastered by Caravaggio, who heavily influenced artists across Europe; amongst these were [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) in Spain and and [Rembrandt](/artist/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-1) in Holland. The exuberance of Baroque aesthetics combined with the fervor of the Catholic Counter-Reformation is evident in the re-constructed St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, a project which was seen to completion by [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini). The taste for Baroque art travelled to the Americas, as evidenced by ornate religious buildings most notably in Mexico and Peru. In France, the century witnessed the consolidation of power under absolute monarchy, whose decadence was made visible in the construction of Louis XIV's royal palace at Versailles; the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was also established under his rule. In the Dutch Republic, whose independence was gained from Spain after 80 years of conflict, an affluent mercantile class created the conditions for a dynamic art market with a preference for portraits, still lifes, cityscapes, and scenes of everyday life.",

Advanced in 1968 as envisioning an art that “speaks directly to the needs and aspirations of Black America” by poet Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) and writer Larry Neal, the Black Arts Movement urged the reinforcement of such mantras as “Black is beautiful” and James Brown’s “Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud” in the form of a recognizable iconography. For example, Jae Jarrell created [_Urban Wall Suit_](/artwork/jae-jarrell-urban-wall-suit) (1969), a multicolored suit crafted to appear as a graffiti-covered brick wall and a walking sign of the public voice. Iconic images of activists such as [Bob Marley](/tag/bob-marley), Angela Davis, and [Malcolm X](/tag/malcolm-x) pervaded art and popular culture at this time, as did other symbols like the raised fist, Afro hairstyle, and vivid graphic patterns inspired by art and textiles of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora).

Its meaning in other aesthetic traditions is less clear (some art historians argue that it should only be used to describe Islamic art).

While faculty members [Robert Motherwell](/artist/robert-motherwell), [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), and [Franz Kline](/artist/franz-kline) made the college a center for [Abstract Expressionist](/gene/abstract-expressionism) painting during the ’40s and early ’50s, the school was the site of many watershed moments for individual artist’s careers. It was at Black Mountain that the sound artist and composer [John Cage](/artist/john-cage) composed his seminal work _4:33_; [Robert Rauschenberg](/artist/robert-rauschenberg) painted his monochromatic “White Paintings”; choreographer Merce Cunningham founded his dance company; and Buckminster Fuller designed the geodesic dome. As such, the school remains one of the most significant 20th-century experiments in arts education, art practice, and design.",

In Western art, paintings were generally made this way until the 15th century, when canvas was adopted as the preferred support across much of Europe.

Depending on where the artist worked, different woods were favored: Italian artists generally painted on poplar, while their Northern counterparts used oak. Canvas was seen as a preferable support due to wood's tendency to split and warp over time, and while it has its own drawbacks (including a more intensive priming process) has proved a more stable ground for paintings.",

Examples of carving can be found in ancient objects the world over, from paleolithic objects decorated with animal forms found in France to Shang dynasty oracle bones incised with ancient writing from China, and classical Greek Caryatid figures still standing today on the Acropolis. Even thousands of years ago, artists like the anonymous sculptor of a voluptuous 10th-century Yogini from India experimented with the ability of carved imagery to operate in both two and three dimensions, creating dramatic volume in contrast to flat space.

Nineteenth-century American painter [Winslow Homer](/artist/winslow-homer) represented the pleasure and peril of the nautical in two iconic works: _Breezing Up a Fair Wind_ (1873–76), in which Winslow captures the leisurely pleasure of a summer sailing day, and _The Life Line_ (1884), which highlights the dangers of the open sea in its dramatic depiction of a near drowning.",

    "description": "The art and architecture of ancient Greece and Rome played a foundational role of the history of Western art, establishing numerous key concepts, techniques, and styles that artists in the subsequent millennia have revisited and responded to in countless ways. These include precise techniques for carving and casting free-standing sculptures and the undertaking of large-scale urban building projects, which stemmed from access to and the skilled use of materials ranging from marble to bronze to concrete. “Man is the measure of all things” was a central maxim in Greek culture, and as such, Greek artists scrutinized human forms closely to create idealized Classical figures. They also presented detailed depictions of mythological narratives, which often accentuated the human traits of the pantheon of gods. Roman artists borrowed heavily from these narratives, while contributing many of their own. These developments in art were accompanied by new forms of political life, most notably the form of democracy that emerged in Athens and reached its height during the 5th century BC (the Parthenon was built 447-432 BC). Athens and its neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean participated in a seafaring culture that resulted in a great amount of cultural and economic exchange. Under the Roman Empire (27 BC-395 AD), territories stretching from the present-day Middle East to Scotland were brought under centralized rule. Beginning in the 4th century, cultural and political power shifted to the east of the empire, with Constantinople becoming the capital in 330 and much of the western territory falling into the hands of northern European conquerors thereafter. Around this time, Christianity began to supplant pagan religion—at first persecuted by the state but in the 4th century becoming the official religion under Constantine, which led to the growth of a new body of iconography that would flourish in [Byzantine Art](/gene/byzantine-art).",

Said’s critique of European discourses that generalized “the Orient”—encompassing North Africa, present-day Turkey and the Middle East—as a unified and relatively primitive racial, geographic, political, and cultural region launched the field of postcolonial studies. As an artistic style, Orientalism is seen to have emerged in the wake of Napoleon Bonaparte’s late 18th century conquests in North Africa as the visual counterpart to the invention of the oriental “other”. Popularized in 19th-century French and British Romantic, as well as Neoclassical, painting, the Orientalist style is characterized by patterns inspired by eastern textiles and architecture, studies of ethnic subjects, and exotic images of the Near East.",

    "description": "Writing systems have existed for thousands of years, but it was not until the early 20th century that linguists—and artists—began to systematically probe the relationship between writing and communication. In 1916 the linguist Ferdinand Saussure proposed that the form a language takes is arbitrary and unrelated to its meaning. A decade later, the French writer Henri Michaux explored these ideas in asemic writing—writing that resembles natural language but conveys no meaning. Since then, artists have developed personal systems of pictograms and glyphs with varying degrees of legibility and idiosyncrasy, often to explore a wide range of concepts. In the 1960s, for example, [A.R. Penck](/artist/ar-penck) drew inspiration from cybernetics, the study of systems, to derive a hieroglyphic-like system of signs, which he used to represent societal and metaphysical relationships. In the 1980s, [Gu Wenda](/artist/wenda-gu) developed a system of meaningless ideograms that resemble traditional [Chinese calligraphy](/gene/east-asian-calligraphy). Given how fundamental writing is to cultures throughout the world, it is no surprise that many personal writing systems may verge on the purely calligraphic, as in the gestural paintings of [Cy Twombly](/artist/cy-twombly).",

    "description": "Artworks that feature young adults—their physical appearances, emotions, and habits—have been a regular and evolving theme in the history of art. In ancient Greece and Rome, an idealized image of youthful beauty emerged in the form of nude sculptures, which reappeared as a focus centuries later in iconic works by [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) artists such as [Donatello](/artist/donatello), [Michelangelo](/artist/michelangelo-buonarroti), [Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini), and [Canova](/artist/antonio-canova). These were associated with various narratives of physical strength, love, and desire. While many artists have continued to work with notions of physical beauty in the 20th century, a parallel tendency has been the exploration of countercultural identities, and young men and women engaged in sexual acts. Photographers in particular, including [Larry Clark](/artist/larry-clark), [Nan Goldin](/artist/nan-goldin), [Robert Mapplethorpe](/artist/robert-mapplethorpe), and [Ryan McGinley](/artist/ryan-mcginley), have explored taboo subjects such as drug use and sexuality in youth culture, often through the documentation of their own friends and experiences. Other explorations of adolescence in art have been less direct; in China, artists of the [Post-’70s Ego Generation](/gene/post-70s-ego-generation) explore their lives and identities in the wake of the country's one-child policy.",

Personified figures are often named after the concept that they represent. In Classical Greek and Roman art, personified figures represented a range of intangible ideas and phenomena,  from the seasons to abstract concepts like Fortune and Victory. Retaining their prominence in art of medieval Europe, personifications also appeared extensively in allegorical works of the European [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) and [Baroque](/gene/baroque) period. The allegories of these periods are often composed of personified figures and symbols that visually reference antiquity to invoke classical ideals and, therefore, universal principles. However, personifications aren’t necessarily classicizing in terms of style, as seen in [Artemesia Gentilleschi](/artist/artemisia-gentileschi)’s _Self Portrait as the Allegory of Painting_. While personification is now well past its heyday as a favored mode of symbolism, some contemporary artists continue to employ personified figures to reference classical ideals or roots in the [Old Masters](/gene/old-masters), in a manner by turns lofty and tongue-in-cheek.",

While graphic design today is more commonly considered a commercial activity, in the early 20th century it was closely aligned with fine art, especially in the journals of avant-garde artists (for example, [Filippo Tommaso Marinetti](/artist/filippo-tommaso-marinetti)’s Futurist publications, Tristan Tzara’s Dada, [Theo Van Doesburg](/artist/theo-van-doesburg-1)’s Stijl, and [Kurt Schwitters](/artist/kurt-schwitters)’s Merz).

The Floating World, as the pleasure districts of Edo (modern day Tokyo) were called, describes the sensory pleasures of urban life, but also offers a bittersweet reminder of the fleeting nature of all worldly delights. It’s commonly said that in Edo Japan, anyone could own a masterpiece Ukiyo-e print for about the price of a bowl of noodles. While this claim oversimplifies, it is true that by the 17th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers innovated centuries-old woodblock text printing techniques to create colorful picture prints that were distributed widely for popular consumption.

    "description": "In his 1993 essay “Black to the Future,” cultural critic Mark Dery coined the term Afrofuturism to describe the cross-cultural philosophy of artists, musicians, and writers who drew on the techno-utopian thinking of the space age to reimagine Black life in the United States. Equally indebted to mythologies of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora), Afrofuturism is not an artistic style but an approach to the intersections of race and technology that aims to visualize the future. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, musicians (Sun Ra, Grace Jones, and Parliament Funkadelic), authors (Octavia Butler), and visual artists ([Renee Cox](/artist/renee-cox)) drew upon the futuristic energy of science fiction, seeing outer space as an escape from the oppressive social and political climate of the Vietnam war and post–Civil Rights era. Afrofuturism’s engagement with the African Diaspora is wide-ranging: photojournalist Cristina de Middel took the failed 1964 Zambian space program as the subject of her 2012 series [_Afronaut_](/artwork/cristina-de-middel-bambuit-from-the-series-the-afronauts).

In the history of art, paintings of windows have often been used to symbolically demarcate inside and outside, public and private, background and foreground. Northern Renaissance, Impressionist, and Fauvist artists, such as [Henri Matisse](https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse), frequently depicted scenes through windows to mediate and direct the viewer’s attention or to play with the idea of a painting as a “window onto the world,” a convention that has existed since the invention of one-point perspective.

Polychrome sculpture, fittingly, is originally associated with Ancient Greece and Rome, and describes all manners of pigmented decoration, gilding, and the application of varied color to a three-dimensional surface. The mostly unadorned, white marble sculptures that were unearthed from archaeological sites in the 16th century—and which later shaped the aesthetic of [neoclassicism](/gene/neoclassicism)—belied the fact that these works were once decorated with a wide variety of colors. Thanks to scientific advances in the study of pigments and other aspects of conservation, art historians have been able to authenticate the former coloration of countless historic objects, a process that has radically changed our assumptions about the history of taste. Common examples of polychromy include decorated [Christian altarpieces](/gene/altarpiece) or the convincing realism of Renaissance-era German limewood sculptures. Polychrome sculpture was later revived in the neoclassical period of the 18th century, and applies to modern and contemporary works like the multicolored mobiles of [Alexander Calder](/artwork/alexander-calder-yellow-disc) or the contemporary, wood-carved figures of [Stephan Balkenhol](/artist/stephan-balkenhol).",

Led by photographers [Kansuke Yamamoto](/artist/kansuke-yamamoto) and Hiroshi Hamaya, Japanese photography of the 1920s and 1930s was largely shaped by the emergence of documentary photography in the United States and by established strains of Western [Pictorialism](/gene/pictorialism) and [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism). Post–World War II Japanese photography was dominated by street photographers [Daido Moriyama](/artist/daido-moriyama), Osamu Kanemura, and Yakuma Nakahir, who used handheld cameras to capture the frenzied claustrophobia of daily life in urban Japan. Such photographers pursued a new photographic form, termed _sunappu shotto_ (“[snapshot](/gene/snapshot-aesthetic”), which was characterized by the aesthetics of rough, blurred, and out of focus images. As photography galleries arrived relatively late to Japan, photography magazines like _Camera Mainichi_, _Asahi Camera_, and most famously _PROVOKE_, as well the medium of the photobook, were integral to the medium’s development and popularity.

Most visual representations of this science take the form of illustrations and diagrams that often blur distinctions between science and art.

Renaissance artists, most famously Leonardo da Vinci, also demonstrated a scientific interest in the human body; Da Vinci created anatomical sketches from autopsies he performed himself. One of the most influential books on anatomy, Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica, published in Basel in 1543, contains lavish woodcut illustrations attributed to the workshop of Titian, highlighting art’s primary role in communicating truth and scientific knowledge during the Renaissance; it was at this time that the study of anatomy became foundational in artistic apprenticeship. Contemporary artists have used anatomy and anatomical drawing to interrogate scientific knowledge or to comment on the powerful relationship between humans and nature. While most medical anatomies in world history have centered on the male body as the universal human form, the anatomy of the female genitalia has been used to represent femininity and female power, from abstracted prehistoric figurines depicting goddesses of fertility to the provocative use of vaginal imagery by feminist artist [Judy Chicago](https://www.artsy.net/artist/judy-chicago) in such works as Rejection Breakthrough Drawing (1974).",

After the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, for example, Chinese artist [Ai Weiwei](/artist/ai-weiwei) hired locals to pound bent rebar from the rubble of their villages straight by hand, creating monumental piles of steel later exhibited at the 2013 Venice Biennale.

Such schema include the four elements of the Western tradition (earth, fire, wind, water) and the Chinese Taoist concept of “Wŭ Xíng,” which explains both natural and aesthetic phenomena as being based on the elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Modern science has defined the chemical properties of elements as a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom, such as gold, iron, hydrogen, or mercury. Artworks in this category may take a single element or entire systems as their subject matter and may explore various natural or synthetic processes related to them, such as the pseudoscience of alchemy or chemical reactions like oxidation, combustion, or precipitation. For example, [Hans Haacke](/artist/hans-haacke)’s _Condensation Cube_ (1965), a hermetically sealed Plexiglas cube filled with water that evaporates and eventually condenses as it is heated by light, uses [Minimalist](/gene/minimalism) forms to explore both biological and chemical processes.",

The term was eventually used to describe backlit images, such as figures or objects in front of a sunset or in a window or a doorway. Despite its etymological origins in the 19th century, the silhouette can be used to describe the black-and-red figure technique in some ancient Greek vase painting.

The industrial revolution, beginning in the late 18th century, introduced increasingly complex machinery that fundamentally altered the production, circulation, and consumption of goods. Throughout the mid-20th century, material innovations, the inventive repurposing of World War II manufacturing processes, and an ethos of collaboration among artists and designers yielded a high point in design history. For example, the bent plywood technique used in Charles and Ray Eames’s [iconic chair](/artwork/charles-and-ray-eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman-2) originated in a leg splint they designed for the Navy. Designers used methods of ethnography, anthropology, anthropometry, ergonomics, and the study of the body and movement to bring human-centered design to the masses (Henry Dreyfuss’s 1937 [Model 203 Telephone](/artwork/henry-dreyfuss-model-302-telephone) was the first to enable hands-free calling; [Dieter Rams](/artist/dieter-rams)’s 1987 Braun calculator influenced the look of the iPhone’s calculator).

    "description": "A term drawn from philosophy and closely associated with the wonders of [nature](/gene/nature), the sublime is meant to describe that which inspires feelings of awe, grandeur, or even anxiety and helplessness in the face of power that surpasses human scale or comprehension. In the 19th century, the German [Romantic](/gene/romanticism) artist [Caspar David Friedrich](/artist/caspar-david-friedrich) famously painted [landscape](/gene/landscapes) scenes as a way to contemplate and depict the sublime, representing tiny [figures](/gene/figures-in-nature) dwarfed by the surrounding scenery. Artists have also evoked the sublime through [abstraction](/gene/abstract-art), such as Abstract Expressionists [Barnett Newman](/artist/barnett-newman) and [Mark Rothko](/artist/mark-rothko), who used large fields of color to envelop and overwhelm the viewer. In [contemporary art](/gene/contemporary-art), photographer [Andreas Gursky](/artist/andreas-gursky) includes more detail than the human eye can perceive in order to represent the digital sublime of the information age. The Internet, global warming, and [globalization](/gene/globalization) have become the exemplars of the modern-day sublime—ideas so vast they are impossible for any individual to grasp.",

Mostly self-trained, the Stars championed individualism and freedom of expression both in their work and public activities. Taking personal experience and social issues as their subject matter, they pointedly diverged from state-sanctioned [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism). The group’s members made history in 1979 when they defied government regulation and mounted an unofficial exhibition in a park adjacent to the National Art Museum in Beijing. When officials closed the exhibition, the group staged a historic protest that became a rallying point for cultural openness in the early years of China’s post–Cultural Revolution political thaw; significantly, they succeeded in reopening the exhibition. The group went on to stage a second public exhibition, though their activities tapered off in the early 1980s, when many members emigrated abroad. The group’s legacy can be seen today in the work of member artists [Ai Weiwei](/artist/ai-weiwei), [Wang Keping](/artist/wang-keping), [Li Shuang](/artist/li-shuang), [Huang Rui](/artist/huang-rui), and affiliates [Zhang Hongtu](/artist/zhang-hongtu) and [Zhang Wei](/artist/zhang-wei-zhang-wei-b-1952).",

As this brutal chapter in world history has had long-reaching social consequences, artists who take the African Diaspora as their subject matter may also deal with the development of post-colonial African nations, or, more broadly, the transnational quality of Black culture at large in the modern world. Often informed by Pan-Africanism, or the solidarity of African peoples worldwide, aesthetic approaches to the African Diaspora may critique the economies of the transatlantic slave trade, histories of colonialism and its legacies, as well as celebrate the cultural and artistic accomplishments of people of African descent (directly countering the alignment of African art with Primitivism, a trend amongst European modern artists like [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and the German Expressionist group [Die Brücke](/gene/die-brucke)).

These artists rose to prominence during a decade dominated by the gestural abstraction of the so-called [New York School](/gene/new-york-school), represented most prominently by [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock).

These representations range from iconic (the idea that the figures have symbolic meaning) to narrative (stories about the gods); they may be figurative—in Classical Greek statuary, for example, the gods took ideal human form—or abstract, as with Aztec art, in which figures are reduced to pattern. Many artists have appropriated sacred imagery for a secular context. [Chris Ofili](https://www.artsy.net/artist/chris-ofili)’s Holy Virgin Mary (1996), for example, is an image of a black Mary that incorporates elephant dung, a provocative melding of the sacred and the profane that caused an uproar when exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1999.

The resulting paste can be applied to walls, cast, or, once dried, carved. Since antiquity, plaster has been used for [frescoes](/gene/fresco) and [reliefs](/gene/relief), both in Roman and [Islamic architecture](/gene/islamic-art-and-architecture). Later, plaster allowed for the easy reproduction of [Greek and Roman](/gene/greek-and-roman-art-and-architecture) masterpieces.

Pre-modern Chinese artists, for example, reproduced paintings of earlier masters as an integral part of their learning process, to proclaim their artistic lineage, or to perpetuate older works created with ephemeral materials. Notably, [ancient Roman](/gene/roman-art-and-architecture) artists produced an unprecedented number of statues that took after [Greek sculpture](/gene/greek-art-and-architecture). The cultural and artistic agency behind these emulations often far exceeded the restrictive meaning of a “copy,” the term art historians have used to describe these works.

    "description": "Commonly regarded as the most difficult printmaking method to learn and master, lithography was invented in Germany in 1796. The technique involves drawing directly on flat stone with an oil-based implement, then coating the stone with a water-based liquid. The applied marks repel the liquid, so that when oil-based ink is applied to the stone it fills in the image, allowing it to be transferred onto a sheet. Since the [19th century](/gene/19th-century), lithography has been widely used by commercial and fine artists as a means to mass-produce images, maps, and texts. It was explored early on by [Eugène Delacroix](/artist/eugene-victor-ferdinand-delacroix-eugene-delacroix) and [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier), but it was artists in the latter half of the 19th century who unleashed the medium with bold experimentation. [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec) and [Édouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet) took to the stone with a marked freedom, depicting motion and fleeting effects of light, while [Pierre Bonnard](/artist/pierre-bonnard) and [Édouard Vuillard](/artist/edouard-vuillard) infused the rich, natural colors of Impressionist pastels and [oil paintings](/gene/oil-painting) into their lithograph prints.

    "description": "_“The real questions are: Does it solve a problem? Is it serviceable? How is it going to look in ten years?” —Charles Eames_\n\nRefined, utilitarian, and far less ornamental than their European counterparts, American designs and their ethos trace back to the Puritan values of the Colonial era. During the 18th century, the American Chippendale style presented a simplified take on the British Baroque and French Rococo aesthetics with its elegantly-carved mahogany furniture. In the 1920s and ‘30s, designers of the [American Studio Craft Movement](/gene/american-studio-craft-movement) such as [Sam Maloof](/artist/sam-maloof) and [George Nakashima](/artist/george-nakashima) continued the tradition of hand-crafted furniture, looking to these historic methods of construction for inspiration. The advent of Modernism in the mid-20th century ushered in some of the biggest names in American design—[Charles and Ray Eames](/artist/charles-and-ray-eames), [Isamu Noguchi](/artist/isamu-noguchi), [George Nelson](/artist/george-nelson), and [Florence Knoll](/artist/florence-knoll) among them—while capitalizing on wartime innovations in materials and manufacturing. In the 1960s, [Wendell Castle](/artist/wendell-castle) produced items that blurred the line between art and furniture, a legacy that is continued by the Texas-born [Haas Brothers](/artist/the-haas-brothers) today.",
