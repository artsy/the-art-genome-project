From the Parthenon frieze and the Easter Island _maoi_ to the Chinese Terracotta Warriors and the prehistoric _Venus of Willendorf_, sculpture is a medium as diverse as it is ancient. Traditionally worked in natural materials like stone, clay, and metal, sculpture encompasses both free-standing works “in-the-round” and reliefs, often serving as architectural elements.

Both American and European artists began to use dirt, rocks, and sand as media and subject matter in the late 1960s, experimenting with diverse approaches. In 1967 the English artist [Richard Long](/artist/richard-long) walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph _A Line Made by Walking_. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson)’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, _Spiral Jetty_, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore. Some of these works address ecological issues like those concerning activists in the 1960s.

To trace the history of nature in art is, essentially, to trace the history of art itself. The ancient Greeks established the imitation of nature as the highest aim of art, and Chinese artists dating from the earliest dynasties have turned to the mountainous landscape as the physical manifestation of _Qi_, the vital energy of the universe. Many major movements of the intervening centuries have been defined by their increasingly subjective treatment of nature. The sweeping [Romantic](/gene/romanticism) landscapes of [J.M.W.

The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed. Puzzled visitors arrived to find the artists making themselves at home in a staged and decidedly average living room (Richter was reading a mystery novel). Of course Capitalist Realism had no such reputation in the U.S.; the artists were parodying the overnight ascendance of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), with its celebrity culture and embrace of everyday commodities, as well as the German craze for all things American.

A general category for artworks that repeat images, elements, or gestures. While repetition has long played a role in art-making—take, for instance, the repetitive nature of the Terracotta Army from China in the 3rd century B.C.—it only truly became central to (and a pronounced element of) the practices of numerous artists in the 20th century, in many respects because of the increased ease of reproducing art and the advent of an infinitely reproducible medium—photography. Walter Benjamin wrote of photographs, ""from a negative… one can make any number of prints; to ask for the 'authentic' print makes no sense."" Such a blurring of the boundary between ""original"" and ""copy"" through repetition paved the way for the factory-like appropriation and creation of images from mass media found in the [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) of Andy Warhol, who in addition to silkscreening images of Campbell's soup cans over and over again was said to have eaten the brand of soup for lunch every day for twenty years.

Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences.

For example, [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti)'s architectural designs made explicit reference to musical harmony and employed ratios that he thought would produce consonances. This type of practice became widespread in Renaissance architecture and soon found a place in investigations of linear perspective in drawing and painting, such as in the work of [Leonardo da Vinci](/artist/leonardo-da-vinci).

Individual portraiture—the likeness of a single person—has long been one of the most popular forms of art. Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted. Many variations in the photographic portrait resulted as did the exploration of how abstract painting might still make a portrait. Artists continue today to reconcile the traditional means of portraiture with photography.",FALSE

The prophet Muhummad's revelations, which were recorded as the contents of the Qu'ran, occurred in the early part of the 7th century. During the spread of Islam in subsequent centuries, a legible script printed on parchment was essential for transporting and sharing the Qu'ran. In the 9th century, paper became the preferred medium, which led to the development of a more fluid, cursive script in place of the more angular style of the past; paper permitted not only the spread of religious texts, but also the publishing of large numbers of secular books. Farsi calligraphy reached its height around 1400 AD and was regularly used for poetry. While Arabic continued to be the language of sacred texts, Farsi was considered the language of highest literary merit, even as far away as the Ottoman and Mughal empires (present-day Turkey and India, respectively). Images of God were forbidden by the Qu'ran, and figurative art was often suspected of idolatry, so calligraphy is amongst the highest art forms in the Muslim world.

Caricatures exaggerate features of individuals for the purpose of humor, mockery or criticism. Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings.

In a series of sober portraits from the 1920s, German photographer [August Sander](/artist/august-sander) systematically documented his countrymen; the uniform staging and composition of these works accentuated social and professional markings, turning his subjects into social types. This series revealed a tension between a photograph’s ability to reveal something of a sitter’s individuality and inner life, and its exact representation of outward appearance. In recent practice, many photographers have also tried to present their subjects as they really are, flaws and all, while allowing for moments of candidness and vulnerability. Less austere (and more deliberate) than a mug shot, these works often bring facial features into high relief, allowing expressiveness to recede and making the sitter seem somehow up-close and removed at the same time.

[Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) artists, concerned with exacting the human form and discovering ideal proportions, began drawing from live models and cadavers at the beginning of the 15th century as preparation for their paintings; ever since, figure studies have been appreciated as wholly independent works of art.

The preparation of studies was later central to the practices of French academic painters and [Neoclassicists](/gene/neoclassicism). While in subsequent years, with the more expressive tendencies of [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism) and [Impressionism](/gene/impressionism), preparatory stages were omitted in favor of direct application of paint on the canvas, the medium endured.

These include precise techniques for carving and casting free-standing sculptures and the undertaking of large-scale urban building projects, which stemmed from access to and the skilled use of materials ranging from marble to bronze to concrete. “Man is the measure of all things” was a central maxim in Greek culture, and as such, Greek artists scrutinized human forms closely to create idealized Classical figures. They also presented detailed depictions of mythological narratives, which often accentuated the human traits of the pantheon of gods. Roman artists borrowed heavily from these narratives, while contributing many of their own. These developments in art were accompanied by new forms of political life, most notably the form of democracy that emerged in Athens and reached its height during the 5th century BC (the Parthenon was built 447-432 BC). Athens and its neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean participated in a seafaring culture that resulted in a great amount of cultural and economic exchange.

Alongside [Arte Povera](/gene/arte-povera), the trans-avant-garde (Italian: transavanguardia) was one of Italy’s most important postwar artistic movements. Its name derives from Italian critic Achille Bonito Oliva’s 1981 essay entitled “The International Trans-Avant-Garde.” In this essay, Oliva named a small group of painters who, in the 1970s, departed from the dominant conceptual tendencies of the previous decade, exploring the expressive potential of painting with often universal or archaic motifs. This practice mirrored similar trends in expressive figurative painting across Europe and the United States, leading to the group’s frequent inclusion in discussions of 1980s [Neo-Expressionism](/gene/neo-expressionism). For Oliva, the trans-avant-garde rejected the original avant-garde’s “hysteria for the new” by returning to styles of the past. Indeed these artists quoted avidly not only from art history and classical mythology, but also popular culture and national symbolism.

Humans have produced clothing for as far back as archeologists can trace, but the modern fashion industry, with its labels, magazines, and the imperative of style, emerged in the late 18th century, primarily as haute couture (“high fashion”). In the 20th century, enabled by the rise of consumer culture and technologies of mass production like the sewing machine, factory-made prêt-à-porter (“ready to wear”) brought fashion into everyday life. Due to the reliance of fashion on commerce and its predominant association with women, its status as an art form worthy of serious scholarly attention has long been debated by art historians.

A decade later, the French writer Henri Michaux explored these ideas in asemic writing—writing that resembles natural language but conveys no meaning.
